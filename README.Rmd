# Cyclistic bike-share

![](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/Case-study-Cyclistic-a-bike-share-company/blob/main/images/logo.PNG)

## Case study by [Douwe Horsthuis](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis) for the Google Data Analytics Capstone

For this case study I am looking at data from a fictional company,
Cyclistic, and I will try to answer questions based on their openly
available data that can be found
[here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

## Steps taken before this using R

1.  download the last 12 months worth of data

2.  unzip all the excel files so they can be uploaded into an SQL
    database (bigquery)

3.  202009-divvy-tripdata does not work

4.  realized it doesn't work quickly so instead use Google drive to
    upload it both for space purposes and speed

5.  create a SQL statement to get the data

6.  made sure that old and new data have the same data types by updating
    the old datatypes so that new data sets can be added easily.

[**This query can be found here in
BigQuery**](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=305573351494:ddd1f3a16d2b4b27b43887c0db15d4bb)

[**The R code can be found
here**](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/Case-study-Cyclistic-a-bike-share-company/blob/main/code.R)

```{r packages & library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install.packages("bigrquery")
library(bigrquery)
library(readr) #for csv
library(knitr) #for kable
library(dplyr) #for basic stuff like count
library(Hmisc) #great library for describing dataframes with strings 
library(pastecs) # to get some easy statistics
library(gridExtra)#for plotting plots in a grid
library(grid)
library(ggplot2)#plots
library(lubridate)#for speeding up data as date (4.1X quicker on my laptop)
library(tidyverse)#general aesthetics 
library(sf)#for maps
library(ggmap)#googlemaps
library(viridis)#colors for heat map
```

Itâ€™s possible to get the dataset directly from Google's bigquery.
However I personally prefer using the csv file. So that is what the code
uses.

```{r using sql to load data, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# db <- dbConnect(
#   bigquery(), 
#   dataset = 'cyclistic-a-bike-share-company.bikedata.combined data', 
#   project = 'cyclistic-a-bike-share-company', 
#   use_legacy_sql = FALSE
# )
# ```
# ```{sql eval=FALSE, connection=db, include=FALSE, output.var=}
# --# Store the project ID
# projectid = "cyclistic-a-bike-share-company"
# 
# --# Set your query
# sql <- SELECT * FROM "cyclistic-a-bike-share-company.bikedata.combined data"
# 
# --# Run the query and store the data in a tibble
# tb <- bq_project_query(projectid, sql)
# 
# --# Print 10 rows of the data
# bq_table_download(tb, n_max = 10)
```

```{r Loading csv file, include=FALSE}
data    <- read_csv("data/sql_query_all.csv")
```

Here you will see the first summary of the data:

```{r first look at the data}
kable(head(data))
cat("\n\nTotal amount of unique ride IDs")
length(unique(data$ride_id))
cat("\n\nTypes of bikes")
unique(data$rideable_type)
cat("\n\nAmount of station names")
length(unique(data$start_station_name))
cat("\n\nAmount of start point")
length(unique(data$f0_))
cat("\n\nAmount of end stations")
length(unique(data$end_station_name))
cat("\n\nAmount of end points")
length(unique(data$f1_))
cat("\n\nTypes of Customer")
unique(data$member_casual)
```

Because `length(unique(data$ride_id))` == the full length of the data,
we now know that every ride is unique and that there is no ID number for
individual members in this data. We now know that there are 3 types of
transportation "docked_bike" "electric_bike" "classic_bike". We know
that
`length(unique(data$start_station_name))==length(unique(data$end_station_name))`==705
, but that both f0 and f1 are not the same length and not the same as
each other. Because of the we leave the ID alone

# Questions about the data

1.  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
    differently?
2.  Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3.  How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to
    become members?

## How to answer the questions / can we answers the questions with the current data

1.  split the data in 2 groups see if there are different trends
2.  see if there is something that is the difference that causes people
    to be in one group or another
3.  not sure if answerable with the current data.

# Preparing the data

To prepare the data there are some things we need to do before we can
create 2 subgroups.

1.  the dates are in the wrong class.
2.  there is no ride length
3.  TBD

```{r Preparing the data}
data$start_date<-ymd_hms(data$started_at)# so it is usable as yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
data$end_date<-ymd_hms(data$ended_at)
data$ride_length<-round(difftime(data$end_date,data$start_date, units = "min")) #creating the difference in minutes
#splitting the data into 2 data frames
data_casual<-subset(data, member_casual=="casual")
data_member<-subset(data, member_casual=="member")
```

## Describing the data after creating the 2 groups

```{r summary stats, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cat("\n\nThese are the casual riders")
describe(data_casual$rideable_type)
describe(data_casual$start_station_name)
describe(data_casual$end_station_name)
summary(data_casual$ride_length)
stat.desc(data_casual$ride_length)

cat("\n\n\n\nThese are the members")
describe(data_member$rideable_type)
describe(data_member$start_station_name)
describe(data_member$end_station_name)
summary(data_member$ride_length)
stat.desc(data_member$ride_length)
```

**Of interest:**

1.  for both groups the dock_bike is the most used by far (69% & 79%)  
2.  Both group have the same most used starts/stops and least used
    starts/stops  
3.  There are minus times (in minutes) and the max time is 58720 minutes
    == 978 hours == 40 days
    -   option 1 - get rid of all minus rides and outliers

    -   option 2 - get rid of all minus riders but leave positive

    -   option 3 - leave all but see how many of these exist
4.  the mean (11.2/44.34) and median (12/22) are very different for
    (members/casual)

## Next we are looking how much trips each group made

```{r by time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#first organize date by month 
data_casual$start_date<-as.Date(data_casual$start_date,format="%Y-%m-%d")
data_casual$ones<-1
data_casual_grouped <- data_casual %>%
  group_by(start_date, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(ones=sum(ones))

data_member$start_date<-as.Date(data_member$start_date,format="%Y-%m-%d")
data_member$ones<-1
data_member_grouped <- data_member %>%
  group_by(start_date, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(ones=sum(ones))




fig1<- ggplot(data=data_casual_grouped, aes(x=start_date, y=ones, color=rideable_type))+
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Amount of rides", title = "Casual Riders", color="Types of Bikes") +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "loess")+
  ylim(0,10000)+
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("Classic bike", "Docked bike", "Electric Bike"), values = c("plum2", "lightblue", "lavenderblush"))


fig2<- ggplot(data=data_member_grouped, aes(x=start_date, y=ones, color=rideable_type))+
    labs(x = "Time", y = "Amount of rides", title = "Members", color="Types of Bikes") +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "loess")+
  ylim(0,10000)+
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("Classic bike", "Docked bike", "Electric Bike"), values = c("plum2", "lightblue", "lavenderblush"))

grid.arrange(fig1,fig2,top=textGrob("Amount of rides per date", gp=gpar(fontsize=20,font=8)))
  
```

We see here an issue, it seems like docked bikes are not existing after
a certain date. When looking into the data, and figuring out how this
could be the case, it seems like the company changed the name
docked_bike to classic_bike. So we need to combine these

But first we are going to try to find out more about the outliers for
this we plot them using the boxplot function

```{r looking for outlier}
boxplot(data_member$ride_length, main="Members")
boxplot(data_casual$ride_length, main="Casual Riders")
```

We see that both groups have only a few negative outlier and a bunch of
positive ones. Before deleting them I want to take a look at a couple of
specific once, just to see if there there isn't just a mistake of
oversight on my part.

We see that the people that have minus time, this has to be wrong. It's
outside of the scope of this case study, but when looking at the data it
was clear that they all had similar dates (2020-12-15). We are getting
rid of them. We also noticed that there are a lot of people with a ride
length of 0-3 minutes that have a start and end point at the same
station. In this case, it might be people who had an issue with the bike
or for whatever reason didn't end up taking it. Since these people won't
give us insight in the behavior of both groups we also get rid of them.

# Mistake 1 restart

I found a mistake, a lot of the extreme values did not have an end
station but did have a start station. This meant that I made a mistake
in the SQL query I originally did. Because of that, I reviewed the code
and found the mistake, and fixed it. Because of that we are reloading
the data and running all the cleaning code we created again. We use
`rm(list = ls())` for the cleaning so we do not need to re-install the
packages

```{r redoing all, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) #clearing everything but packages
data    <- read_csv("data/sql_query_all_updated.csv")
```

```{r first look at the updated data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(head(data))
cat("\n\nTotal amount of unique ride IDs")
length(unique(data$ride_id))
cat("\n\nTypes of bikes")
unique(data$rideable_type)
cat("\n\nAmount of station names")
length(unique(data$start_station_name))
cat("\n\nAmount of start point")
length(unique(data$start_station_id))
cat("\n\nAmount of end stations")
length(unique(data$end_station_name))
cat("\n\nAmount of end points")
length(unique(data$end_station_id))
cat("\n\nTypes of Customer")
unique(data$member_casual)
```

Nothing changed except as expected the total amount of rides decreased ,
which means that we can run the rest of the code.

```{r Preparing the data 2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data$start_date<-ymd_hms(data$started_at) # so it is usable as yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
data$end_date<-ymd_hms(data$ended_at)
data$ride_length<-round(difftime(data$end_date,data$start_date, units = "min")) #creating the difference in minutes
#getting rid of the negative numbers
data <- filter(data, ride_length > -0.01)
data <- filter(data, start_station_name!=end_station_name)

```

The same here, nothing changed a lot so we still want to look at the
same data. When thinking more about outliers, I am not sure if we want
to just exclude them. So instead we are are leaving the code here, but
we are only excluding people that took a bike out for over 12hours.
Since it would be very unlikely that they are using 1 bike for that
long. Unfortunately there is no way of seeing if there was a complaint
about unable to dock a bike.

# Back to the questions:

1.  split the data in 2 groups see if there are different averages
    -   We see that there are both groups have very different means,
        this tells us something about that members use the bikes for
        shorter trips (median).
2.  see if there is something that is the difference that causes people
    to be in one group or another
3.  not sure if answerable with the current data.

While these maps could be great for social media to show how much
stations there are or how across the city people are using the bikes, it
doesn't show a clear difference in group.

## Bike usage across a year

The last thing we want to look at is if either group changes their use
of the bikes over the course of the year For this we plot the data as a
function of time and keep it divided by group

```{r by time 2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#first organize date by month 
data_casual$start_date<-as.Date(data_casual$start_date,format="%Y-%m-%d")
data_casual$ones<-1
data_casual_grouped <- data_casual %>%
  group_by(start_date, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(ones=sum(ones))

data_member$start_date<-as.Date(data_member$start_date,format="%Y-%m-%d")
data_member$ones<-1
data_member_grouped <- data_member %>%
  group_by(start_date, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(ones=sum(ones))




fig17<- ggplot(data=data_casual_grouped, aes(x=start_date, y=ones, color=rideable_type))+
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Amount of rides", title = "Casual Riders", color="Types of Bikes") +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  ylim(0,10000)+
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("Classic bike", "Electric Bike"), values = c("plum2", "lightblue"))


fig18<- ggplot(data=data_member_grouped, aes(x=start_date, y=ones, color=rideable_type))+
    labs(x = "Time", y = "Amount of rides", title = "Members", color="Types of Bikes") +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  ylim(0,10000)+
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("Classic bike", "Electric Bike"), values = c("plum2", "lightblue"))

grid.arrange(fig17,fig18,top=textGrob("Amount of rides per date", gp=gpar(fontsize=20,font=8)))
  
```

This shows us that the member group uses the bikes more. This counts for
both types of bikes.

# Answering questions

1.  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclist bikes
    differently? From what I see this has mainly to do with ride length.
    Where as the members (surprisingly?) use the bike for less longer
    distances as you can see here:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grid.arrange(fig3, fig4,ncol=2,top=textGrob("Ride length in minutes by bike type", gp=gpar(fontsize=20,font=1)))
```

they seem to use them more often, as you can see here:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grid.arrange(fig17,fig18,top=textGrob("Amount of rides per date", gp=gpar(fontsize=20,font=8)))
```

When looking at location we do not see a relevant difference between the
two groups we see both groups pretty much spread out around Chicago in
the same way.

```{r plotting casual and members docked bike location in a heatmap, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fig5 + labs(title = str_c('Casual Riders'))
fig9 + labs(title = str_c('Members'))
grid.arrange(fig7, fig9,ncol=2,top=textGrob("Start points across Chicago", gp=gpar(fontsize=20,font=1)))
```

1.  Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? I'd argue
    that there is a point to be made that if people figure out how easy
    and useful/healthy it can be to take the bike, they might opt for a
    membership. Since members use bike on average for smaller distances,
    this could relate to how easy it is to use and how it can increase
    ones mobility.
2.  How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to
    become members?

-   They can use the heat maps showing in a cool way how people across
    the city of Chicago are using bikes everywhere.
-   They can focus on how after using it once and experiencing how easy
    it is, that using it for picking up groceries, going to a friend, or
    in short using it in daily life for short distances would make life
    more eco-friendly, easier, healthier and cheaper.

# disclaimer

The data is missing for September 2020, since the excel file is corrupt.
There is unfortunately no way to deal with that, since it's an
corruption before the data was uploaded.
